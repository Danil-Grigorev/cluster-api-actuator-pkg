# CVO Metrics

The Cluster Version Operator reports the following metrics:

The cluster version is reported as seconds since the epoch with labels for `version` and
`image`. The `type` label reports which value is reported:

* `current` - the version the operator is applying right now (the running CVO version) and the age of the payload
* `cluster` - the initial version of the cluster, and value is the creation timestamp of the cluster version (cluster age)
* `failure` - if the failure condition is set, reports the last transition time for both desired and current versions
* `desired` - reported if different from current as the most recent timestamp on the cluster version
* `completed` - the time the most recent version was completely applied, or absent if not reached
* `updating` - if the operator is moving to a new version, the time the update started

The `from_version` label is set where appropriate and is the previous completed version for the provided `type`. Empty for
`cluster`, and otherwise empty if there was no previous completed version (still installing).

Metrics reported while applying the image:

```
